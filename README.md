PDF Block Diagram Extractor and Langchain Integration
Overview:
This project integrates PDF extraction, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and advanced NLP models using Langchain, HuggingFace, and FAISS. The goal is to process PDFs, extract images (especially block diagrams), and recognize associated text (titles and descriptions). After extraction, embeddings are created for textual data, enabling document similarity searches and answering queries based on the retrieved content using large language models (LLMs).

Key Components:
1.PDF Extraction (PyMuPDF):The primary objective is to extract images (like block diagrams) and figure titles from PDF files. Using PyMuPDF (fitz library), the script reads each page of the PDF and retrieves any embedded images.
Text from the page is also extracted to identify and link titles (like "Fig 1.1") to their corresponding images.

2.OCR (Tesseract):Once an image (block diagram) is extracted, OCR is performed using Tesseract to recognize textual components embedded in the image. This is helpful when figures or diagrams contain text that is relevant to the analysis.
The OCR output is processed in detail to extract clean, structured text data, which is used later for searching specific components.

3.Image Annotation:After extracting and processing images and their associated titles, the images are annotated with the figure titles for better clarity. This is achieved by creating a new image canvas, attaching the title below the original diagram, and saving it as a new image.

4.Search Functionality:The code allows searching for specific figure titles and textual components from the OCR output. For instance, you can search for a diagram related to "computer architecture" and then look for specific terms like "processor" within the diagramâ€™s text.

5.Langchain Integration:
Document Loading: Langchain is used to manage documents from the PDF files. It loads documents, splits them into smaller chunks, and organizes them for retrieval.
Text Embeddings: The HuggingFaceEmbeddings are used to create vector embeddings for the documents. These embeddings are a mathematical representation of the document's text, allowing for efficient similarity searches.
FAISS and BM25: The project uses two retrieval models:
FAISS: A vector-based search tool that uses the document embeddings to find the most similar documents based on a query.
BM25: A traditional term-frequency retrieval model that finds relevant documents based on keyword matching.
Ensemble Retriever: The system combines the outputs of FAISS and BM25 to provide balanced retrieval results, offering both semantic and keyword-based search capabilities.

6.Large Language Model (LLM) Integration:The project uses transformer models (like Mistral-7B-Instruct) to answer user queries based on retrieved documents. This is facilitated by the HuggingFace pipeline for text generation.
The LLM is prompted with custom templates that ensure it provides accurate answers based on the provided context and retrieved documents, helping with complex queries.

7.Prompt Template:A predefined template guides the LLM in generating responses. It encourages the model to stick to factual, document-based answers, ensuring that the information is relevant and contextual.

8.Retrieval-based QA:The system can answer user queries by first retrieving relevant documents using the ensemble retriever (BM25 + FAISS). The documents are processed, and the LLM provides a summary or direct answer based on the retrieved information.
This is particularly useful for analyzing technical documents where a specific question needs to be answered based on detailed text (e.g., "What is a computer?").

9.Performance Optimization:Efficient query processing is ensured by using in-memory embeddings and caches. The retrieval process combines speed and accuracy through vector-based searches (FAISS) and term-based searches (BM25), ensuring fast response times.

Workflow:

PDF Loading and Image/Text Extraction:PDFs are loaded, and all images (especially block diagrams) and text are extracted from each page.
OCR is performed on the images to extract embedded text, which is processed for further analysis.

Document Splitting and Embedding:The extracted text is split into manageable chunks. These chunks are then embedded into vector space using HuggingFace models, which enables similarity-bsed searches.

Querying the System:Users can query the system with specific questions (e.g., "What is in diagram 1.1?"), and the system will retrieve relevant documents using BM25 and FAISS.
The query and document information are then passed to the LLM, which generates a well-formed response.

Important Tools and Libraries:
PyMuPDF (Fitz): For reading PDF documents and extracting images and text.
Tesseract (OCR): For recognizing text from images.
Langchain: For managing document retrieval, embeddings, and query-response mechanisms.
FAISS: For efficient similarity-based document retrieval.
BM25: For traditional keyword-based document retrieval.
Transformers (HuggingFace): For integrating and running large language models that can generate context-aware answers.

Use Cases:
Technical Document Analysis: Extracting block diagrams and associated descriptions from engineering or research PDFs, with the ability to search for specific components.
Query-based Retrieval: Answering questions based on the content extracted from PDFs using a combination of keyword and vector-based search.
Diagram Identification: Automatically labeling diagrams with their titles and making them searchable based on image content and associated text.

Conclusion:
This project effectively combines document processing, image extraction, and AI-powered retrieval for a robust system capable of answering detailed queries based on the content of technical PDF documents.
